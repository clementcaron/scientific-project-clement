Apply the Game of Life rules based on the cell's state and the number of live neighbors. Update the corresponding cell in the copy.

    "intermediate_steps": [
      "Step 1: Understand the problem and identify key requirements**\n\nThe core task is to create a 7-day itinerary for a European tour, starting and ending in London, visiting Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin. The budget is $2000 USD, and the interests are museums, historical sites, and local cuisine. Transportation should be primarily by train, with flights as a backup. Accommodation should be mid-range hotels/hostels. The travel dates are flexible, but summer is preferred. The itinerary needs to be day-by-day, including specific activities, costs, travel times, and backup options.\n\n**Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller components**\n\nWe can break this down into the following components:\n\n*   **Route Planning:** Determine the optimal order of cities to minimize travel time and cost.\n*   **Transportation:** Research train and flight options between cities, calculating travel times and costs.\n*   **Accommodation:** Research mid-range hotel/hostel options in each city, considering price and location.\n*   **Activities:** Research museums, historical sites, and local cuisine options in each city, including estimated costs.\n*   **Budgeting:** Track all costs to ensure the itinerary stays within the $2000 budget.\n*   **Day-by-Day Schedule:** Create a detailed schedule for each day, including travel, activities, and estimated costs.\n*   **Backup Options:** Identify alternative activities for bad weather.\n\n**Step 3: Plan your approach or algorithm**\n\n1.  **Route Optimization:** Start with a basic route (London -> Paris -> Amsterdam -> Berlin -> London) and consider alternatives to minimize travel time.\n2.  **Transportation Research:** Use websites like Trainline, Omio, and Skyscanner to research train and flight options. Prioritize trains.\n3.  **Accommodation Research:** Use websites like Booking.com, Hostelworld, and TripAdvisor to find mid-range hotels/hostels.\n4.  **Activity Research:** Use travel guides, websites like TripAdvisor, and local blogs to find activities.\n5.  **Cost Calculation:** Estimate costs for transportation, accommodation, activities, food, and miscellaneous expenses.\n6.  **Itinerary Creation:** Create a day-by-day schedule, incorporating travel, activities, and estimated costs.\n7.  **Budget Tracking:** Regularly update the budget to ensure it stays within the limit.\n8.  **Backup Options:** Identify alternative activities for each city in case of bad weather.\n9.  **Refinement:** Review and adjust the itinerary based on cost, time, and feasibility.\n\n**Step 4: Implement/work through the first part (Route Planning and Transportation)**\n\nLet's start with the route. The most logical route seems to be London -> Paris -> Amsterdam -> Berlin -> London.\n\n*   **London to Paris:** Train is the most convenient option. The Eurostar takes approximately 2.5 hours.\n*   **Paris to Amsterdam:** Train is also a good option, taking approximately 3-4 hours.\n*   **Amsterdam to Berlin:** Train takes approximately 6-7 hours.\n*   **Berlin to London:** Train is possible, but it's a long journey (around 9-10 hours) with multiple changes. A flight might be more efficient.\n\nLet's start with estimating transportation costs:\n\n*   **London to Paris (Eurostar):** Estimate $70 - $150 (can vary significantly based on booking time and class). Let's average this at $110.\n*   **Paris to Amsterdam (Train):** Estimate $50 - $100 (again, varies). Let's average this at $75.\n*   **Amsterdam to Berlin (Train):** Estimate $60 - $120. Let's average this at $90.\n*   **Berlin to London (Flight):** Estimate $50 - $100 (budget airlines). Let's average this at $75.\n\nTotal estimated transportation cost: $110 + $75 + $90 + $75 = $350.\n\n**Step 5: Continue with subsequent parts (Accommodation and Activities - Day 1-2)**\n\nNow let's start building the itinerary.\n\n**Day 1: London to Paris**\n\n*   **Morning:** Travel from London to Paris via Eurostar. (2.5 hours, $110). Allow time for check-in and security at St. Pancras International.\n*   **Afternoon:** Arrive in Paris. Check into accommodation. (Let's estimate $75/night for a hostel or budget hotel, so $75 for this night).\n*   **Afternoon/Evening:** Explore the area around your accommodation. Have dinner at a local bistro. (Dinner: $25)\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit a museum like the Louvre (entrance fee approx. $20) or Musée d'Orsay (entrance fee approx. $16).\n\n**Day 2: Paris**\n\n*   **Morning:** Visit the Eiffel Tower (pre-book tickets to avoid long queues - approx. $30).\n*   **Afternoon:** Explore the Latin Quarter, visit Notre Dame (exterior view), and wander along the Seine.\n*   **Evening:** Enjoy a traditional French dinner. (Dinner: $30)\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit the Centre Pompidou (modern art museum - entrance fee approx. $15) or take a cooking class.\n\n**Estimated Costs for Days 1-2:**\n\n*   Transportation: $110\n*   Accommodation: $75 + $75 = $150\n*   Activities: $30 + $0 = $30 (Eiffel Tower)\n*   Food: $25 + $30 = $55\n*   **Total: $345**\n\n**Step 6: Continue with subsequent parts (Amsterdam and Berlin)**\n\n**Day 3: Paris to Amsterdam**\n\n*   **Morning:** Enjoy a leisurely breakfast in Paris.\n*   **Late Morning/Early Afternoon:** Travel from Paris to Amsterdam by train (3-4 hours, $75).\n*   **Afternoon:** Check into accommodation in Amsterdam. (Let's estimate $75/night for a hostel or budget hotel, so $75 for this night).\n*   **Afternoon/Evening:** Explore the canals and enjoy the atmosphere. Dinner at a local restaurant. (Dinner: $25)\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit the Rijksmuseum (Dutch Masters - entrance fee approx. $22) or the Van Gogh Museum (entrance fee approx. $20).\n\n**Day 4: Amsterdam**\n\n*   **Morning:** Visit the Anne Frank House (book tickets well in advance - approx. $16).\n*   **Afternoon:** Explore the Jordaan district, visit a cheese shop, and consider a canal cruise (approx. $20).\n*   **Evening:** Enjoy dinner and explore the nightlife. (Dinner: $30)\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit the Hermitage Amsterdam (branch of the St. Petersburg museum - entrance fee approx. $20) or a coffee shop.\n\n**Estimated Costs for Days 3-4:**\n\n*   Transportation: $75\n*   Accommodation: $75 + $75 = $150\n*   Activities: $16 + $20 = $36 (Anne Frank House, Canal Cruise)\n*   Food: $25 + $30 = $55\n*   **Total: $316**\n\n**Day 5: Amsterdam to Berlin**\n\n*   **Morning:** Enjoy a final breakfast in Amsterdam.\n*   **Late Morning/Early Afternoon:** Travel from Amsterdam to Berlin by train (6-7 hours, $90).\n*   **Afternoon/Evening:** Check into accommodation in Berlin. (Let's estimate $75/night for a hostel or budget hotel, so $75 for this night). Explore the area around your accommodation. Dinner at a local restaurant. (Dinner: $25)\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit the DDR Museum (interactive museum about East German life - entrance fee approx. $12).\n\n**Day 6: Berlin**\n\n*   **Morning:** Visit the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag Building (book in advance for free entry).\n*   **Afternoon:** Visit the East Side Gallery (remnants of the Berlin Wall) and Checkpoint Charlie.\n*   **Evening:** Enjoy dinner and explore the nightlife. (Dinner: $30)\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit the Neues Museum (Egyptian Museum, including the bust of Nefertiti - entrance fee approx. $12) or the Topography of Terror Documentation Center (free entry).\n\n**Estimated Costs for Days 5-6:**\n\n*   Transportation: $90\n*   Accommodation: $75 + $75 = $150\n*   Activities: $0 + $0 = $0 (Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, East Side Gallery, Checkpoint Charlie - many free options)\n*   Food: $25 + $30 = $55\n*   **Total: $295**\n\n**Day 7: Berlin to London**\n\n*   **Morning:** Enjoy a final breakfast in Berlin.\n*   **Morning/Early Afternoon:** Travel from Berlin to London by flight (approx. $75). Allow time for airport transfers and check-in.\n*   **Afternoon:** Arrive in London.\n*   **Evening:** Free time in London.\n*   **Backup:** If it rains, visit a London museum (British Museum, National Gallery - free entry).\n\n**Estimated Costs for Day 7:**\n\n*   Transportation: $75\n*   Accommodation: $0\n*   Activities: $0\n*   Food: $0\n*   **Total: $75**\n\n**Step 7: Budget Tracking and Refinement**\n\nLet's summarize the estimated costs:\n\n*   Transportation: $350\n*   Accommodation: $150 + $150 + $150 + $0 = $450\n*   Activities: $30 + $36 + $0 = $66\n*   Food: $55 + $55 + $55 + $0 = $165\n*   **Total Estimated Cost: $1031**\n\nThis is well within the $2000 budget. We have significant room for flexibility and potential upgrades (e.g., nicer accommodation, more expensive activities, more meals out).\n\n**Step 8: Complete the solution and verify**\n\n**"

      "Step 1: Understand the problem and identify key requirements**\n\nThe core task is to create a 7-day itinerary for a European tour, starting and ending in London, with visits to Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin. We have a budget of $2000 USD, and the itinerary should cater to interests in museums, historical sites, and local cuisine. Transportation should primarily be by train, with flights as a backup. Accommodation should be mid-range hotels or hostels. The travel dates are flexible, with a preference for summer. The final output should be a day-by-day schedule with specific activities, estimated costs, and travel times, including backup options for bad weather.\n\n**Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller components**\n\nWe can break this down into the following components:\n\n*   **Route Planning:** Determine the optimal order of cities to minimize travel time and cost.\n*   **Transportation:** Research train and flight options between cities, considering travel times and costs.\n*   **Accommodation:** Research and select mid-range hotels/hostels in each city, considering price and location.\n*   **Activities:** Identify and plan activities in each city based on interests (museums, historical sites, local cuisine), considering opening hours and costs.\n*   **Cost Calculation:** Estimate the cost of transportation, accommodation, activities, and food in each city.\n*   **Time Management:** Allocate time for travel, activities, and meals, ensuring a balanced schedule.\n*   **Weather Contingency:** Plan backup activities for rainy days.\n*   **Budget Management:** Ensure the total cost stays within the $2000 budget.\n\n**Step 3: Plan your approach or algorithm**\n\n1.  **Route Optimization:** Start with a basic route (London -> Paris -> Amsterdam -> Berlin -> London) and consider alternative routes to see if any are more efficient.\n2.  **Transportation Research:** Research train and flight options between each city pair. Prioritize trains for cost-effectiveness and scenic views.\n3.  **Accommodation Research:** Search for mid-range hotels/hostels in each city, focusing on central locations and good reviews.\n4.  **Activity Planning:** Research attractions in each city (museums, historical sites, food markets, etc.) and create a list of potential activities.\n5.  **Day-by-Day Schedule:** Create a detailed day-by-day schedule, including travel times, activity durations, and meal times.\n6.  **Cost Estimation:** Estimate the cost of each activity, accommodation, transportation, and food.\n7.  **Budget Check:** Calculate the total cost and adjust the itinerary if necessary to stay within the budget.\n8.  **Weather Contingency:** Include backup indoor activities for each city.\n9.  **Finalize and Verify:** Review the itinerary for feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and enjoyment.\n\n**Step 4: Implement/work through the first part (Route Planning & Transportation)**\n\nLet's start with route planning and transportation. The most logical route seems to be London -> Paris -> Amsterdam -> Berlin -> London.\n\n*   **London to Paris:** Train (Eurostar). This is the most convenient and often cost-effective option.\n*   **Paris to Amsterdam:** Train (Thalys or similar).\n*   **Amsterdam to Berlin:** Train (Nightjet or similar) or a daytime train.\n*   **Berlin to London:** Flight (Ryanair, EasyJet, or similar) or a combination of train and ferry. A flight is likely to be the most time-efficient and budget-friendly option.\n\nLet's estimate travel times and costs (these are estimates and will need to be refined later):\n\n*   **London to Paris (Train):** 2.5 hours. Cost: $70 - $150 (depending on booking time and class). Let's assume $100.\n*   **Paris to Amsterdam (Train):** 3-4 hours. Cost: $50 - $120 (depending on booking time and class). Let's assume $90.\n*   **Amsterdam to Berlin (Train):** 6-7 hours (daytime) or overnight (Nightjet). Cost: $40 - $100 (depending on booking time and class). Let's assume $80.\n*   **Berlin to London (Flight):** 1.5-2 hours flight + travel to/from airports. Cost: $30 - $80 (depending on booking time and airline). Let's assume $60.\n\n**Step 5: Continue with subsequent parts (Accommodation & Activities)**\n\nNow, let's research accommodation and activities. We'll do this city by city.\n\n**Paris:**\n\n*   **Accommodation:** Mid-range hotels/hostels. Let's budget $70/night.\n*   **Activities:**\n    *   Eiffel Tower: $30 (entry)\n    *   Louvre Museum: $20 (entry)\n    *   Notre Dame Cathedral (exterior view, free; or visit Sainte-Chapelle $12)\n    *   Walk along the Seine River (free)\n    *   Local Cuisine: Consider a crepe or a baguette. Budget $20/day for food.\n    *   Backup (Rainy Day): Musée d'Orsay (Impressionist art)\n\n**Amsterdam:**\n\n*   **Accommodation:** Mid-range hotels/hostels. Let's budget $70/night.\n*   **Activities:**\n    *   Anne Frank House (book in advance, $15)\n    *   Rijksmuseum (Dutch Masters, $22)\n    *   Canal Cruise ($20)\n    *   Walk around the Jordaan district (free)\n    *   Local Cuisine: Try stroopwafels or bitterballen.

Budget $20/day for food.\n    *   Backup (Rainy Day): Pergamon Museum\n\n**London:**\n\n*   **Accommodation:** We'll need two nights in London (start and end). Budget $70/night.\n*   **Activities:**\n    *   British Museum (free)\n    *   Tower of London ($40)\n    *   Walk along the Thames (free)\n    *   Local Cuisine: Fish and chips or a pub meal. Budget $20/day for food.\n    *   Backup (Rainy Day): National Gallery\n\n**Step 6: Day-by-Day Schedule & Cost Estimation**\n\nLet's create a day-by-day schedule and estimate the costs.\n\n**Day 1: London to Paris**\n\n*   Morning: Travel from London to Paris (Eurostar).\n*   Afternoon: Check into accommodation. Explore the area near the hotel.\n*   Evening: Eiffel Tower (book in advance).

Prioritize trains where possible, and compare costs and travel times.\n3.  **Accommodation Research:** Search for mid-range hotels/hostels in each city, considering location, reviews, and price. Book accommodations in advance.\n4.  **Activity Planning:** Research key attractions, museums, historical sites, and local cuisine options in each city. Create a daily schedule, balancing sightseeing with free time.\n5.  **Cost Calculation:** Estimate the costs for each activity, transportation, accommodation, and food.\n6.  **Time Allocation:** Allocate time for travel, activities, and meals each day.\n7.  **Weather Contingency Planning:** Identify indoor activities as backup options for rainy days.\n8.  **Budget Control:** Track the estimated costs and adjust the itinerary if necessary to stay within the budget.\n9.  **Itinerary Compilation:** Compile the day-by-day itinerary with all details, including transportation, accommodation, activities, costs, and backup options.\n\n**Step 4: Implement/work through the first part (Route Planning and Transportation)**\n\nLet's start with route planning. The most logical and potentially efficient route seems to be:\n\n*   **Day 1:** London to Paris\n*   **Day 2-3:** Paris\n*   **Day 4:** Paris to Amsterdam\n*   **Day 5:** Amsterdam\n*   **Day 6:** Amsterdam to Berlin\n*   **Day 7:** Berlin to London\n\nNow, let's research transportation.\n\n*   **London to Paris:** The Eurostar train is the most convenient option. A one-way ticket can range from $60-$150 USD depending on the booking time and class. Let's estimate $80. Travel time is approximately 2.5 hours.\n*   **Paris to Amsterdam:** Train is again the best option. The Thalys or other high-speed trains take about 3-4 hours. Tickets can range from $50-$120 USD. Let's estimate $70.\n*   **Amsterdam to Berlin:** Train is also a good option, taking around 6-7 hours. Tickets can range from $40-$100 USD. Let's estimate $60.\n*   **Berlin to London:** This is the trickiest. A direct train isn't available. The best option is likely a combination of train to Brussels or Paris and then the Eurostar to London. This could take a long time. Another option is a flight. Flights are often cheaper and faster. Let's research flights. A flight from Berlin to London can cost $30-$100 USD. Let's estimate $60.\n\n**Estimated Transportation Costs:** $80 + $70 + $60 + $60 = $270\n\n**Step 5: Continue with subsequent parts (Accommodation and Activities - Day 1)**\n\n**Day 1: London to Paris**\n\n*   **Morning:** Travel from London to Paris via Eurostar (2.5 hours).\n*   **Afternoon:** Arrive in Paris. Check into accommodation. Let's budget $60/night for accommodation.\n*   **Afternoon/Evening:** Explore the area around the hotel. Have dinner at a local bistro.\n*   **Backup (Rainy Day):** Visit a museum near the hotel (e.g., Musée Rodin)\n\n**Accommodation Research (Paris):**\n\n*   **Mid-range Hotel/Hostel:** Research options near Gare du Nord or Gare de l'Est (convenient for train travel). Consider options like Generator Paris (hostel) or Hotel Saint-André des Arts.

      "Generated Approach 1: **Sequential City Planning with Budget Allocation.** This approach focuses on planning each city visit sequentially, allocating a portion of the budget to each city upfront. We'll start with London, then plan Paris, Amsterdam, and Berlin, and finally return to London. Within each city, we'll plan activities, accommodation, and transportation, considering budget constraints. We'll prioritize train travel but use flights if necessary to save time or money.",
      "Generated Approach 2: **Route Optimization with Activity Prioritization.** This approach focuses on optimizing the travel route first. We'll consider different orderings of the cities (e.g., London -> Paris -> Amsterdam -> Berlin -> London, or London -> Berlin -> Amsterdam -> Paris -> London) and choose the most efficient route based on travel time and cost. Then, we'll prioritize activities within each city based on interest (museums, historical sites, cuisine) and available time. We'll use a spreadsheet or similar tool to track costs and ensure we stay within budget.",
      "Generated Approach 3: **Iterative Refinement with Constraint Satisfaction.** This approach starts with a rough draft itinerary, including city order, estimated travel times, and initial activity ideas. Then, we'll iteratively refine the itinerary, adjusting activities, accommodation, and transportation based on budget constraints and time limitations. We'll use a constraint satisfaction approach, identifying conflicts (e.g., exceeding budget, insufficient time) and resolving them by modifying the itinerary. We'll also incorporate backup options for bad weather at each stage.",

We'll start in London, then plan Paris, then Amsterdam, then Berlin, and finally back to London. For each city, we'll allocate a budget, plan activities, and estimate costs. Transportation costs will be calculated between cities. We'll use a spreadsheet-like structure to track the budget and make adjustments as needed. Backup options will be considered for each day.",
      "Generated Approach 2: **Route Optimization with Cost Prioritization.** This approach focuses on optimizing the route and minimizing travel time and cost. We'll first determine the most efficient route between the four cities (London, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin) using a travel time and cost matrix. Then, we'll allocate the budget across the entire trip, prioritizing transportation and accommodation costs. Activities will be planned around the chosen route and allocated budget. Backup options will be considered for each city based on weather and interest.",
      "Generated Approach 3: **Iterative Refinement with Constraint Satisfaction.** This approach starts with a rough draft itinerary, including estimated costs and travel times. Then, it iteratively refines the itinerary by considering constraints (budget, interests, travel dates) and making adjustments.

Consider using version control (e.g., Git) to tag the current production version for easy rollback.\n        3.  **Configuration Backup:**\n            1.  Backup the current configuration files.  This might involve copying files from `/etc/` or a similar location, depending on the application.  (e.g., `cp -r /etc/application_config /path/to/backup/config_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)`).\n    2.  **Gather Deployment Information:**\n        1.  Identify the target servers/environments for deployment.\n        2.  Obtain the new version's deployment package (e.g., a `.war`, `.jar`, or a directory of files).\n        3.  Document the deployment package version.\n        4.  Identify any dependencies or prerequisites for the new version.\n    3.  **Review Rollback Procedure:**\n        1.  Confirm the rollback procedure is documented and understood.\n        2.  Ensure access to the previous version's application code and database backup.\n\n**Step 5: Continue with subsequent parts (Deployment, Configuration, Testing, Post-Deployment)**\n\n2.  **Deployment Phase:**\n    1.  **Stop the Application:** Gracefully shut down the existing application on the target servers.\n    2.  **Deploy the New Version:**\n        1.  Transfer the deployment package to the target servers.\n        2.  Extract/install the new version's files (e.g., deploy the `.war` file to the application server, copy the application files to the correct directory).\n    3.  **Database Migration:**\n        1.  If database migrations are required, execute them using the appropriate tool (e.g., `flyway migrate`, `rails db:migrate`, or a custom script).\n        2.  Verify that the migrations complete successfully.\n3.  **Configuration Phase:**\n    1.  **Update Configuration Files:** Modify the application's configuration files with the new settings (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, etc.).\n    2.  **Restart the Application:** Restart the application on the target servers.\n4.  **Testing Phase:**\n    1.  **Basic Functionality Tests:**\n        1.  Verify the application is running without errors.\n        2.  Check core functionalities (e.g., login, data retrieval, basic CRUD operations).\n    2.  **Advanced Testing (if applicable):**\n        1.  Run automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end).\n        2.  Perform manual testing to cover critical user flows.\n        3.  Monitor application logs for errors.\n    3.  **Decision Point:**\n        1.  **If tests pass:** Proceed to the Post-Deployment Phase.\n        2.  **If tests fail:** Rollback to the previous version (see Rollback Procedure below).\n5.  **Post-Deployment Phase:**\n    1.  **Notification:**\n        1.  Notify the team (e.g., via Slack, email) that the deployment is complete.\n        2.  Include the deployment version and any relevant details.\n    2.  **Documentation Update:**\n        1.  Update the application documentation to reflect the new version's features and changes.\n        2.  Update any relevant runbooks or operational guides.\n    3.  **Rollback Procedure (if needed):**\n        1.  **Stop the New Version:** Shut down the newly deployed application.\n        2.  **Restore the Application Code:** Deploy the backed-up application code (or revert to the tagged version in version control).\n        3.  **Restore the Database:** Restore the database backup created during the preparation phase.\n        4.  **Restore Configuration:** Restore the backed-up configuration files.\n        5.  **Restart the Application:** Restart the application.\n        6.  **Notify the Team:** Inform the team about the rollback and the reason for it.\n\n**Step N: Complete the solution and verify**"

      "Generated Approach 1: **Chronological Decomposition:** Break down the instructions into a strict chronological sequence, starting with the very first action and proceeding linearly to the last. This approach prioritizes a simple, easy-to-follow order.",
      "Generated Approach 2: **Categorical Grouping:** Group the instructions into logical categories (e.g., \"Preparation,\" \"Deployment,\" \"Verification,\" \"Post-Deployment\"). This approach aims to improve readability and organization by clustering related tasks together.",
      "Generated Approach 3: **Dependency-Driven Sequencing:** Identify dependencies between tasks (e.g., database migration must happen before application deployment). Then, construct a sequence based on these dependencies, ensuring that prerequisite steps are completed before dependent steps. This approach prioritizes correctness and avoids potential errors.",
