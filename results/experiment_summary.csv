1.  **Backup the Existing Production Environment:**
    *   Action: Create a full backup of the database (specify database type, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), application code (e.g., using `git tag` and archiving the code), and configuration files (e.g., using `tar` or a configuration management tool).
    *   Details:
        *   Backup Location: `/path/to/backup/` (or cloud storage)
        *   Naming Convention: `backup_db_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz`, `backup_app_code_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`, `backup_config_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`
