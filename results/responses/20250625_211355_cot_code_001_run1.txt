Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Step 1: [Understand the problem and identify key requirements]

The problem is to implement Conway's Game of Life. The key requirements are:
- A `Grid` class to represent the game board.
- Initialization of the grid with a given size.
- Implementation of the four rules of the Game of Life.
- Methods to display the grid, advance one generation, and count live neighbors.
- A test case with a known pattern.
- A runnable script to show several generations.
Step 2: Step 2: [Break down the problem into smaller components]

We can break this down into the following components:
1.  `Grid` class:
    *   `__init__(self, rows, cols)`: Initializes the grid with a given size.
    *   `display(self)`: Displays the grid to the console.
    *   `count_live_neighbors(self, row, col)`: Counts the live neighbors of a cell.
    *   `advance_generation(self)`: Advances the grid to the next generation based on the rules.
2.  Helper functions (within the `Grid` class or as separate functions):
    *   Possibly a function to check if a cell is alive or dead.
3.  Main script:
    *   Creates a `Grid` object.
    *   Initializes the grid with a test pattern.
    *   Runs the game for a specified number of generations, displaying each generation.
Step 3: Step 3: [Plan your approach or algorithm]

1.  **`Grid` class initialization:** Create a 2D list (list of lists) to represent the grid. Initialize all cells to dead (e.g., 0).
2.  **`display()`:** Iterate through the grid and print each cell (e.g., "X" for alive, "." for dead).
3.  **`count_live_neighbors()`:** Iterate through the 8 neighbors of a cell and count the live ones. Handle edge cases (cells at the borders).
4.  **`advance_generation()`:**
    *   Create a copy of the grid to store the next generation's state.
    *   Iterate through each cell in the original grid.
    *   For each cell, count its live neighbors.
    *   Apply the Game of Life rules to determine the cell's state in the next generation and update the copy.
    *   Replace the original grid with the copy.
5.  **Main script:**
    *   Create a `Grid` object with specified dimensions.
    *   Initialize the grid with a test pattern (e.g., blinker or glider).
    *   Loop for a certain number of generations:
        *   Display the grid.
        *   Advance the generation.
        *   (Optional) Add a delay to visualize the generations.
Step 4: Step 4: [Implement/work through the first part]

Let's start with the `Grid` class and its initialization.

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]  # 0: dead, 1: alive

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(["X" if cell == 1 else "." for cell in row]))
```
Step 5: Step 5: [Continue with subsequent parts]

Now, let's implement `count_live_neighbors()` and `advance_generation()`.

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]  # 0: dead, 1: alive

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(["X" if cell == 1 else "." for cell in row]))

    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count

    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for row in range(self.rows):
            for col in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(row, col)
                if self.grid[row][col] == 1:  # Cell is alive
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
                else:  # Cell is dead
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid
```
Step 6: Step 6: [Complete the solution and verify]

Now, let's create the main script with a test case (blinker).

```python
import time

class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]  # 0: dead, 1: alive

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(["X" if cell == 1 else "." for cell in row]))

    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count

    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for row in range(self.rows):
            for col in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(row, col)
                if self.grid[row][col] == 1:  # Cell is alive
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
                else:  # Cell is dead
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid


if __name__ == "__main__":
    rows = 10
    cols = 10
    grid = Grid(rows, cols)

    # Blinker pattern
    grid.grid[5][4] = 1
    grid.grid[5][5] = 1
    grid.grid[5][6] = 1

    generations = 10
    for i in range(generations):
        print(f"Generation {i + 1}:")
        grid.display()
        grid.advance_generation()
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Add a delay to visualize the generations
```
