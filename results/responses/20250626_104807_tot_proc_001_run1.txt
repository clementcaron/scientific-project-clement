Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Generated Approach 1: **Chronological Decomposition.** This approach breaks down the instructions linearly, following the order they appear in the prompt. It focuses on identifying each action mentioned and creating a step for it. This is a straightforward approach, easy to understand and implement, but might not be the most efficient or robust.
Step 2: Generated Approach 2: **Dependency-Based Decomposition.** This approach identifies dependencies between tasks. For example, backing up the database must happen before the database migration. It then structures the procedure based on these dependencies, ensuring that prerequisite steps are completed before dependent steps. This approach aims for a more logical and safer deployment process.
Step 3: Generated Approach 3: **Categorical Decomposition.** This approach groups related tasks into categories, such as "Preparation," "Deployment," "Verification," and "Post-Deployment." Within each category, it then outlines the specific steps. This approach aims for better organization and clarity, making it easier to understand the overall deployment process and locate specific steps.
Step 4: Generated Approach 2: Dependency-Based Decomposition** because it prioritizes safety and logical order, which is crucial for a deployment process. While slightly more complex, the benefits of ensuring dependencies are met outweigh the added effort.

DETAILED EXECUTION:

Step 1: Identify Dependencies:
*   **Backup:** Must happen before any changes are made.

*   **Config Updates:** Must happen before testing the new version.
*   **Testing:** Must happen after deployment, database migration, and config updates.
*   **Rollback:** Can happen at any point if something breaks, but should ideally be done after testing.
*   **Notification:** Should happen after successful deployment.
*   **Documentation Update:** Should happen after successful deployment.
