Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Thought: The instructions are vague and need to be broken down into smaller, actionable steps. I need to identify the core tasks: backup, deploy, test, migrate database, update configs, rollback, notify, and update documentation. I'll start with the backup process. | Action: Create a step for backing up the existing production environment. | Observation: Created step 1: "1. Backup the existing production environment. This should include all application code, configuration files, and the database. Specify the backup method (e.g., full backup, incremental backup) and the location where the backup will be stored (e.g., cloud storage, local server)."
