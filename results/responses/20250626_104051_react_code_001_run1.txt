Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Thought: I need to start by defining the Grid class and its initialization. The grid will be represented by a 2D array (list of lists). I'll also need to initialize the grid with a given size and optionally with a starting state. | Action: Create the Grid class and its initialization method.
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
        if initial_state:
            for r in range(rows):
                for c in range(cols):
                    self.grid[r][c] = initial_state[r][c]

``` | Observation: The Grid class is initialized with rows, cols, and an optional initial state. The grid is represented by a list of lists, initialized with all dead cells (0). If an initial state is provided, it's used to populate the grid.
Step 2: Thought: Now I need to implement the `count_live_neighbors` method. This method will take row and column indices as input and return the number of live neighbors for the cell at that position. I need to handle boundary conditions correctly. | Action: Implement the `count_live_neighbors` method.
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
        if initial_state:
            for r in range(rows):
                for c in range(cols):
                    self.grid[r][c] = initial_state[r][c]

    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count
``` | Observation: The `count_live_neighbors` method correctly counts live neighbors, handling boundary conditions by using `max` and `min` to stay within the grid's bounds.
Step 3: Thought: Next, I need to implement the `advance_generation` method. This method will iterate through each cell in the grid, apply the Game of Life rules, and update the grid's state. I'll need to create a temporary grid to store the next generation's state to avoid modifying the grid while iterating. | Action: Implement the `advance_generation` method.
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
        if initial_state:
            for r in range(rows):
                for c in range(cols):
                    self.grid[r][c] = initial_state[r][c]

    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count

    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(r, c)
                if self.grid[r][c] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 0
                else:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid
``` | Observation: The `advance_generation` method correctly applies the Game of Life rules using a temporary grid to store the next generation's state.
Step 4: Thought: Now, I need to implement the `display` method to visualize the grid. This method will simply print the grid to the console. | Action: Implement the `display` method.
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
        if initial_state:
            for r in range(rows):
                for c in range(cols):
                    self.grid[r][c] = initial_state[r][c]

    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count

    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(r, c)
                if self.grid[r][c] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 0
                else:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(['X' if cell == 1 else '.' for cell in row]))
``` | Observation: The `display` method now prints the grid to the console, using 'X' for live cells and '.' for dead cells.
Step 5: Thought: Now I need to create a simple test case with a known pattern. I'll use the "blinker" pattern. Then, I'll write the main part of the script to run the simulation for a few generations and display the grid at each step. | Action: Create the main part of the script with the blinker pattern and simulation loop.
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
        if initial_state:
            for r in range(rows):
                for c in range(cols):
                    self.grid[r][c] = initial_state[r][c]

    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count

    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(r, c)
                if self.grid[r][c] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 0
                else:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[r][c] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(['X' if cell == 1 else '.' for cell in row]))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Blinker pattern
    initial_state = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    ]

    grid = Grid(5, 5, initial_state)

    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Generation {i}:")
        grid.display()
        grid.advance_generation()
        print()
``` | Observation: The script now initializes a grid with the blinker pattern, displays the initial state, and then advances and displays the grid for 5 generations.
