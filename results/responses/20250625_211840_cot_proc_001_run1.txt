Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Step 1: Understand the problem and identify key requirements**

The core objective is to create a detailed, step-by-step procedure for deploying a new software version to production. The vague instruction provides several key requirements:

*   **Backup:** Create a backup of the current system.
*   **Testing:** Test the new version after deployment.
*   **Database Migration:** Perform any necessary database migrations.
*   **Configuration Updates:** Update configuration files.
*   **Rollback:** Have a rollback plan in case of failure.
*   **Notification:** Inform the team upon completion.
*   **Documentation:** Update the documentation.

**Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller components**

We can break down the deployment process into these logical components:

1.  **Pre-Deployment:** Actions to be taken *before* deploying the new version.
2.  **Deployment:** The actual process of deploying the new version.
3.  **Post-Deployment:** Actions to be taken *after* the new version is deployed.
4.  **Rollback Procedure:** Steps to follow if the deployment fails.

**Step 3: Plan your approach or algorithm**

We'll create a numbered list for each component, detailing the specific steps. Each step should be clear, concise, and actionable. We'll also include placeholders for specific commands or details that will depend on the specific system being deployed.

**Step 4: Implement/work through the first part (Pre-Deployment)**

1.  **Pre-Deployment:**
    1.  **Backup the Current System:**
        1.  Connect to the production server via SSH: `ssh [user]@[server_ip]`
        2.  Create a full backup of the application files: `[command to backup application files, e.g., tar -czvf /path/to/backup/app_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz /path/to/application]`
        3.  Create a database backup: `[command to backup the database, e.g., mysqldump -u [db_user] -p[db_password] [database_name] > /path/to/backup/db_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql]`
        4.  Verify the backup files were created successfully.
        5.  (Optional) Download the backup files to a local machine for safekeeping.
    2.  **Review Configuration:**
        1.  Review the configuration files for the new version to identify any necessary updates.
        2.  Note down the current configuration values.
    3.  **Database Migration Preparation:**
        1.  Review the database migration scripts.
        2.  Ensure the migration scripts are ready to be executed.
        3.  (Optional) Test the migration scripts in a staging environment.
    4.  **Inform the Team:**
        1.  Send a notification to the team about the upcoming deployment, including the estimated downtime and any potential impact.

**Step 5: Continue with subsequent parts (Deployment)**

2.  **Deployment:**
    1.  **Stop the Application:**
        1.  Stop the current application service: `[command to stop the application service, e.g., sudo systemctl stop [service_name]]`
    2.  **Deploy the New Version:**
        1.  Upload the new version files to the production server: `[command to upload files, e.g., scp -r [local_path_to_new_version] [user]@[server_ip]:/path/to/application]`
        2.  Update the application files in the deployment directory: `[command to update files, e.g., rm -rf /path/to/application/* && cp -r /path/to/new_version/* /path/to/application/]`
    3.  **Update Configuration:**
        1.  Update the configuration files with the new values: `[command to update configuration files, e.g., replace values in config files]`
    4.  **Run Database Migrations:**
        1.  Execute the database migration scripts: `[command to run database migrations, e.g., php artisan migrate]`
    5.  **Start the Application:**
        1.  Start the new application service: `[command to start the application service, e.g., sudo systemctl start [service_name]]`

**Step 6: Continue with subsequent parts (Post-Deployment)**

3.  **Post-Deployment:**
    1.  **Basic Functionality Testing:**
        1.  Access the application in a web browser.
        2.  Verify the core functionality of the application.
        3.  Check for any error messages.
    2.  **Detailed Testing:**
        1.  Perform more thorough testing, including testing critical user flows.
        2.  Check the logs for any errors or warnings.
    3.  **Monitor Application Performance:**
        1.  Monitor application performance metrics (CPU, memory, response times) for a period of time.
    4.  **Notify the Team:**
        1.  Send a notification to the team confirming successful deployment and providing a link to the application.

**Step 7: Continue with subsequent parts (Rollback Procedure)**

4.  **Rollback Procedure:**
    1.  **Stop the New Application:**
        1.  Stop the new application service: `[command to stop the application service, e.g., sudo systemctl stop [service_name]]`
    2.  **Restore the Application Files:**
        1.  Delete the new application files.
        2.  Restore the application files from the backup: `[command to restore application files, e.g., rm -rf /path/to/application/* && tar -xzvf /path/to/backup/app_backup_*.tar.gz -C /path/to/application]`
    3.  **Restore the Database:**
        1.  Drop the current database.
        2.  Restore the database from the backup: `[command to restore database, e.g., mysql -u [db_user] -p[db_password] [database_name] < /path/to/backup/db_backup_*.sql]`
    4.  **Start the Old Application:**
        1.  Start the old application service: `[command to start the application service, e.g., sudo systemctl start [service_name]]`
    5.  **Notify the Team:**
        1.  Send a notification to the team about the rollback, including the reason for the rollback.

**Step 8: Complete the solution and verify**

The procedure is now complete. We've covered pre-deployment, deployment, post-deployment, and rollback procedures. The steps are clear, concise, and actionable. We've also included placeholders for system-specific commands.
