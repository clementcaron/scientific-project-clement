Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Step 1: [Understand the problem and identify key requirements]
The problem is to implement Conway's Game of Life. This involves creating a grid, applying the game's rules to update the grid's state over generations, and displaying the grid. The key requirements are:
- A Grid class for representing the game board.
- Initialization of the grid with a given size.
- Implementation of the four rules of the Game of Life.
- Methods to display the grid, advance to the next generation, and count live neighbors.
- A test case with a known pattern.
- A runnable script to demonstrate the game.
Step 2: Step 2: [Break down the problem into smaller components]
The problem can be broken down into the following components:
1.  **Grid Class:**
    *   `__init__`: Initialize the grid with a given size (rows, cols) and optionally a starting state.
    *   `display`: Print the grid to the console.
    *   `count_live_neighbors`: Count the number of live neighbors for a given cell.
    *   `advance_generation`: Apply the Game of Life rules to update the grid's state.
2.  **Game Logic:**
    *   Implement the four rules of the Game of Life within the `advance_generation` method.
3.  **Test Case:**
    *   Create a starting pattern (e.g., a blinker or glider).
4.  **Main Script:**
    *   Create a `Grid` instance.
    *   Initialize the grid with the test pattern.
    *   Run the game for several generations, displaying the grid at each step.
Step 3: Step 3: [Plan your approach or algorithm]
1.  **Grid Class Initialization:** Create a 2D list (list of lists) to represent the grid. Initialize all cells to dead (0) by default, or use the provided starting state.
2.  **`display` method:** Iterate through the grid and print each cell, using characters like 'X' for live and '.' for dead.
3.  **`count_live_neighbors` method:** Iterate through the 8 neighbors of a given cell. Handle edge cases (cells at the boundaries) to avoid index out-of-bounds errors.
4.  **`advance_generation` method:** Create a copy of the grid to store the next generation's state. Iterate through each cell in the original grid. For each cell, count its live neighbors. Apply the Game of Life rules to determine the cell's state in the next generation and update the corresponding cell in the copy. Finally, replace the original grid with the copy.
5.  **Test Case:** Define a starting pattern (e.g., a blinker) as a list of coordinates. Use these coordinates to set the initial state of the grid.
6.  **Main Script:** Create a `Grid` instance, initialize it with the test pattern, and then loop through several generations, calling the `advance_generation` and `display` methods in each iteration.
Step 4: Step 4: [Implement/work through the first part]
Let's start with the `Grid` class and its initialization and display methods.

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]  # 0: dead, 1: alive

        if initial_state:
            for row, col in initial_state:
                if 0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols:  # Validate coordinates
                    self.grid[row][col] = 1

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(['X' if cell == 1 else '.' for cell in row]))
```
Step 5: Step 5: [Continue with subsequent parts]
Now, let's implement the `count_live_neighbors` method.

```python
    def count_live_neighbors(self, row, col):
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count
```
Step 6: Step 6: [Implement `advance_generation` method]
```python
    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for row in range(self.rows):
            for col in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(row, col)
                if self.grid[row][col] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
                else:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid
```
Step 7: Step 7: [Create a test case (blinker) and the main script]
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Blinker test case
    initial_state = [(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)]  # Coordinates of live cells
    grid = Grid(5, 5, initial_state)

    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Generation {i}:")
        grid.display()
        grid.advance_generation()
        print()
```
Step 8: Step 8: [Complete Solution and Verification]
```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols, initial_state=None):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]  # 0: dead, 1: alive

        if initial_state:
            for row, col in initial_state:
                if 0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols:  # Validate coordinates
                    self.grid[row][col] = 1

    def display(self):
        for row in self.grid:
            print("".join(['X' if cell == 1 else '.' for cell in row]))

        count = 0
        for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(self.rows, row + 2)):
            for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(self.cols, col + 2)):
                if (i, j) != (row, col) and self.grid[i][j] == 1:
                    count += 1
        return count

    def advance_generation(self):
        next_grid = [[0 for _ in range(self.cols)] for _ in range(self.rows)]
        for row in range(self.rows):
            for col in range(self.cols):
                live_neighbors = self.count_live_neighbors(row, col)
                if self.grid[row][col] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if 2 <= live_neighbors <= 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
                else:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 1
                    else:
                        next_grid[row][col] = 0
        self.grid = next_grid


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Blinker test case
