Reasoning Steps:
==================================================
Step 1: Generated Approach 1: Use a 2D list (list of lists) to represent the grid. Implement the game rules by iterating through each cell and counting its neighbors. Create a new grid to store the next generation and then update the original grid.
Step 2: Generated Approach 2: Use a NumPy array to represent the grid. NumPy provides efficient array operations, which could speed up neighbor counting and grid updates. Implement the game rules using array slicing and vectorized operations.
Step 3: Generated Approach 3: Use a dictionary to represent the grid, where keys are (row, col) tuples and values are the cell states (alive/dead). This approach could be more memory-efficient for sparse grids (grids with few live cells). Implement the game rules by iterating through the live cells and their neighbors.
Step 4: Evaluated Approach 1: Pros: Simple to understand and implement. Cons: Less efficient for large grids due to nested loops. Feasibility: 9/10
Step 5: Evaluated Approach 2: Pros: Efficient due to NumPy's optimized array operations. Cons: Requires NumPy installation. Feasibility: 9/10
Step 6: Evaluated Approach 3: Pros: Potentially memory-efficient for sparse grids. Cons: More complex to implement, might be slower than NumPy for dense grids. Feasibility: 7/10
Step 7: Selected Best Approach: Approach 2. NumPy offers a good balance of efficiency and ease of implementation for this task. While requiring an external library, NumPy is widely used and provides significant performance benefits.
Step 8: Execution Step 1: Install NumPy.
Step 9: Execution Step 2: Create a Grid class that initializes with a given size (rows, cols). The grid will be a NumPy array of integers (0 for dead, 1 for alive).
Step 10: Execution Step 3: Implement a method to display the grid (e.g., using print).
Step 11: Execution Step 4: Implement a method to count live neighbors for a given cell. Use array slicing to efficiently check the 8 neighbors. Handle edge cases (cells on the border).
Step 12: Execution Step 5: Implement a method to advance one generation. Iterate through the grid, count live neighbors for each cell, and apply the game rules to determine the next state of each cell. Create a new grid for the next generation.
Step 13: Execution Step 6: Implement a method to update the grid to the next generation.
Step 14: Execution Step 7: Create a simple test case (e.g., a blinker or glider) to initialize the grid.
Step 15: Execution Step 8: Write a main function that runs the game for a specified number of generations and displays the grid at each generation.
